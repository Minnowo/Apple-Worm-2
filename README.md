this is a fan game of the infamous Apple Worm from cool math games

this is a rhythm i made in my high school computer science class  
this was made in about 2-3 weeks and is my first game using unity  

most of the song mapping was taken from osu song maps, and converted into a scriptable object using a python script  
its not very user friendly so good luck trying to use that if you want more levels  
the spikes / apples were hand placed  
all of the music is from the osu song map files as well
